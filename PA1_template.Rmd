```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r activity data}
# download activity data file from web
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", destfile = "repdata_data_activity.zip", mode="wb")
# unzip activity data and read 
unzip("repdata_data_activity.zip")
stepdata <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
head(stepdata)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
The missing values in the dataset are ignored.
### 1 Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r total steps taken per day}
steps <- aggregate(stepdata$steps, by = list(Date = stepdata$date), FUN = sum)
library(ggplot2)
names(steps)[names(steps) == "x"] <- "Total"
temp <- as.Date(steps$Date, "%Y-%m-%d")
steps$Date <- format(temp, format = "%m-%d")
head(steps)
```

### 2 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r histogram}
hist1 <- ggplot(data = na.omit(steps), aes(Total)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1500, colour = "white") +
    xlab("Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day") +
    ylab("Count") +
    ggtitle("Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day")
print(hist1)
```

### 3 Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r mean and median}
mean(na.omit(steps$Total))
median(na.omit(steps$Total))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
### 1 Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis) type = “l” means the plot is line graph.

```{r time series plot}
five_min_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = stepdata, FUN =mean)
TimeSeries1 <- ggplot(data = five_min_steps, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + 
    geom_line() +
    xlab("Time Intervals (5 Minutes is an unit)") + 
    ylab("Total Number of Steps") +
    ggtitle("Average Number of Steps Taken of the 5-Minute Interval")
print(TimeSeries1)
```

### 2 Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r max average number of steps}
five_min_steps[which(five_min_steps$steps == max(five_min_steps$steps)),]
```

## Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

### 1 Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r missing values in the dataset}
sapply(X = stepdata, FUN = function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

### 2 Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc. I will use the mean for that 5 -minute interval to replace all the missing values in the dataset. At the end, I will check if all the NAs have been replaced.

```{r To fill missing values in the dataset}
library(dplyr)
replace_with_mean <- function(num) replace(num, is.na(num), mean(num, na.rm = TRUE))
meanday <- (stepdata %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(steps = replace_with_mean(steps)))
head(meanday)
sum(is.na(meanday))
```

### 3 Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r with no missing values in the dataset}
new_dataset <- as.data.frame(meanday)
head(new_dataset)
summary(new_dataset)
```

### 4 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps? We make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day first by using the new version dataset

```{r Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day with New Version Dataset}
TotalDataByDay <- aggregate(new_dataset$steps, by=list(new_dataset$date), sum)

names(TotalDataByDay)[1] ="date"
names(TotalDataByDay)[2] ="totalsteps"
head(TotalDataByDay,15)
```

### 4a Summary of new data : mean & median

```{r Summary of new data : mean & median}
summary(TotalDataByDay)
```

### 4b Making a histogram

```{r Making a histogram}
hist(TotalDataByDay$totalsteps, xlab = "Steps", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Total Daily Steps", breaks = 20)
```

### 4C Compare the mean and median of Old and New dataMaking a histogram

```{r compare mean and median}
oldmean <- mean(steps$Total, na.rm = TRUE)  
newmean <- mean(TotalDataByDay$totalsteps)
# Old mean and New mean
oldmean
newmean
oldmedian <- median(steps$Total, na.rm = TRUE)
newmedian <- median(TotalDataByDay$totalsteps)
# Old median and New median
oldmedian
newmedian
```

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r Comparison of Average Number of Steps in Each Interval}
new_dataset$date <- as.Date(new_dataset$date)
new_dataset$weekday <- weekdays(new_dataset$date)
new_dataset$weekend <- ifelse(new_dataset$weekday=="Saturday" | new_dataset$weekday=="Sunday", "Weekend", "Weekday" )

library(ggplot2)
meandataweekendweekday <- aggregate(new_dataset$steps , by= list(new_dataset$weekend, new_dataset$interval), na.omit(mean))
names(meandataweekendweekday) <- c("weekend", "interval", "steps")

ggplot(meandataweekendweekday, aes(x=interval, y=steps, color=weekend)) + geom_line()+
facet_grid(weekend ~.) + xlab("Interval") + ylab("Mean of Steps") +
    ggtitle("Comparison of Average Number of Steps in Each Interval")
```
